# DEPRECATED

This repository has been broken into several projects under https://github.com/opensatelliteproject 

The idea is to maintain each one of the projects that was here in separated repositories so it's easier to find anything that is needed. This repository will only be kept for historical purposes, and only for some time (until I migrate everything to OSP group).

A Open Satellite Receiver Project (who knows in the future maybe a Transmitter as well? :) )

For now we have working:

* GOES Demodulator / Decoder / Packet Parser
* SatHelper Library
* APT Decoder (not a good one though)
* BitDisplay
